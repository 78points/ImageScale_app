# ImageScale


ImageScale is simple Desktop Application for quick resizing and manipulating all images in selected folder.
This app aim to speed up process of creating thumbnail images for websites.
I have built this app with Node.js and Node Webkit ( however in order to use this app installing Node.js is not require )
Application can create thumbnail version of images, apply some filters and rename them with prefix.
Currently this application is available on Mac OS X 64-bit system.
Windows users please stay tuned.

##How to use:
*   download and unzip ImageScale_app-master.zip
*   click ImageScale.app to run application
*   select folder with big (original images )
*   select empty folder for thumbnails
*   set required size of thumbnails, optional filters and quality
*   pres Submit and wait for thumbnails to be created.


Please note that on some computers when processing large quantity of images it can take some time for Image Scale to create all thumbnails, so please be patient or process up to 20 images at the same time.

If you copy ImageScale.app to your Application folder app will be accessible via Launchpad
